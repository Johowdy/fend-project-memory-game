## Instructions for Playing Game

To play this Memory Card Matching Game, begin by clicking on a card to flip the card over and  
display its symbol.  Next, click on another card to view its symbol.  If the two
cards match, they will remain face-up.  Otherwise, they will quickly flip face down.  As you flip the cards, try to remember the card placement and the symbol on each card.  The game is won when all the cards match. The game will track number of moves and the time it takes to win. If you want to restart the game at any time, simply click on the reload symbol. Have fun!
